Do not use a Vertex AI managed dataset:

> We recommend that you write your code to load data from a source outside of Vertex AI, such as BigQuery or Cloud Storage. Alternatively, you can use a Vertex AI managed dataset, but we don't recommend it; managed datasets are better suited for AutoML models.
