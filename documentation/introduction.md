# Introduction

Welcome! This project aims to make it easier to start using Google Cloud
Platform for AI work. It has these specific purposes:

- Make it easier to set up an online graphical virtual workstation for
  interactive work.
- Make it easier to run batch jobs using powerful Vertex AI hardware.
- Enable GPU acceleration without needing to configure things such as drivers
  or libraries.

It includes a basic project template to get things started quickly and without
problems, and a few simple utilities to make setup and usage easier.

If you would like to run an interactive graphical workstation, you can start at
the [cloud workstation guide](cloud-workstation-guide.md). If you want to run a
powerful training job, please see the [vertex AI guide](vertex-ai-guide.md).
If you aren't sure, why not start with an interactive workstation, then move on
to Vertex AI if you need more performance.
